I’ll devote hours or even days\nto whatever it is.  As time passes, however, my interest sometimes tapers off.</p>\n<p>While I do manage to finish a lot of what I start, I have to admit that there are a lot of things I haven’t seen through to completion.\nMy bookshelf has quite a few unfinished books.  My game library is full of games that didn’t hold my attention.\nHobbies are interesting, but some of them only for a while.  Getting a project “Mostly done” or “good enough”\nis fine with me in some cases.</p>\n<h2>“Why” is the difference-maker</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1591846447/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=1591846447&linkCode=as2&tag=chrisrouffe09-20&linkId=f56c7c33b7278cddc9ddbfcdd8aecb48\">Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action</a><img src=\"//ir-ca.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=chrisrouffe09-20&l=am2&o=15&a=1591846447\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></p>\n<p>If the “Why” is important to me, then it will be worth the effort.  Some of my recent “Whys”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spent hours on a quirky game.  Why?  The game had a good system of accomplishments and things to try next.  It was relaxing and peaked my curiosity</li>\n<li>Ate a lot of chocolate over the holidays.  Why?  It tasted great, and I loved the sugar-rush</li>\n<li>Stopped eating a lot of junk.  Why?  It ran afoul of my other fitness and health goals</li>\n<li>\n<p>Read a book by an author that I’d never heard of.  Why?  Someone suggested it as a really good book</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m reading every other book by that author.  Why?  I really learned a lot from the first one</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some other ones that come to mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spending time and money to build a guitar because I wanted the challenge, and because it produced something useful</li>\n<li>Drag my lazy self to the dojo multiple times per week because I’m always training for the next level</li>\n<li>Invest hours of rehearsal into guitar, bass, or drums, because I get a huge thrill out of playing live music</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I have a “Why” then I can usually stay with it.  I’m hoping that the “Whys” I have for this blog\nwill keep me on track, and help me to stay with it</p>\n<h1>Why am I writing this blog?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Learn, or improve, my own skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blogging</li>\n<li>Publishing</li>\n<li>Writing</li>\n<li>Design</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Share things that I am passionate about</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computer Engineering</li>\n<li>Martial Arts</li>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>Music</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Build relationships</li>\n<li>Create and cultivate a “Personal Brand”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope that you, the reader, are able to find some use or enjoyment in the posts I make, and that I stay true to the “Whys” that started this project.</p>\n<p>Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","date":"January 21, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/","previous":null,"next":null}}
