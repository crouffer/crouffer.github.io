### Early Spring Cleaning

I've made a mess:  I have articles and blog posts across a bunch of platforms.  After trying a few different solutions, I am finally ready to do some cleaning.  Over the next while I'm moving everything onto [my domain](https://chrisrouffer.com), then sharing out to other platforms.

I apologize in advance if get notices for reposts of some of my older writings or articles.

While moving things Iâ€™ll take the opportunity to edit, refine, and improve my content. Consider it a 2nd edition, with improved clarity and accuracy.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.

Chris
