“Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it.” — Henry Ford

Imagine what would happen to your thinking if you were to get the best thoughts from 12 very great thinkers every year.  Even if these 12 “Great minds” all disagreed with each other, you'd still open your minds and expand your thinking in remarkable ways.

I have a revolutionary idea: We should all spend 20 minutes a day reading a real book, one that has actually been published.

Most of us spend a lot of time every day on social media, watching TV, or reading online news. What if we took 20 minutes of that time to read a book instead?

Just now I just took the time to carefully read one page out of a book. That page took me almost exactly 2 minutes to read.  With my lightning quick math skills, I calculate that in 20 minutes I could read 10 pages.  If I were to do that every day I'd be learning from 300 pages of edited, vetted and approved writing per month.  This is text that is proven to marketable and intelligent, or at least convincing enough to spend time and money publishing it. 

Imagine the effects of consuming 1 book per month.  It almost doesn’t matter what book. Each author has their own take on the world. Each genre has its own spin.  All of these intelligible thoughts add up to help us form our own ideas and sharpen our own perspectives.

Books are typically well thought-out.  They are read (and re-read), edited, and refined, all before ever being published. Books are full of ideas that have been through multiple levels of scrutiny. They have been invested in, or even slaved over. If a book makes it all the way to the printer it should be respected.  If it makes enough of an impact to get your attention, it likely can teach you something worthwhile.

You don’t have to buy books. You can borrow them from friends. You can go to a library. Read whatever you like! Fiction, non-fiction, history, drama, horror… If it was worth publishing, it’s probably worth reading. In one way or another, that book will expand your mind.

I challenge you to take 20 minutes every day to read an actual, published book, paper, ebook, or audiobook. It will enrich your life.
