It's always fun to start something new.

I love starting to read a new book, play a new video game, begin a project, or try out a hobby.
At the beginning I am always full of energy and passion.  I'll devote hours or even days
to whatever it is.  As time passes, however, my interest sometimes tapers off.

While I do manage to finish a lot of what I start, I have to admit that there are a lot of things I haven't seen through to completion.
My bookshelf has quite a few unfinished books.  My game library is full of games that didn't hold my attention.
Hobbies are interesting, but some of them only for a while.  Getting a project "Mostly done" or "good enough"
is fine with me in some cases.

## "Why" is the difference-maker

If the "Why" is important to me, then it will be worth the effort.  Some of my recent "Whys":
- Spent hours on a quirky game.  Why?  The game had a good system of accomplishments and things to try next.  It was relaxing and peaked my curiosity
- Ate a lot of chocolate over the holidays.  Why?  It tasted great, and I loved the sugar-rush
- Stopped eating a lot of junk.  Why?  It ran afoul of my other fitness and health goals
- Read a book by an author that I'd never heard of.  Why?  Someone suggested it as a really good book
    - I'm reading every other book by that author.  Why?  I really learned a lot from the first one

Some other ones that come to mind:
- Spending time and money to build a guitar because I wanted the challenge, and because it produced something useful
- Drag my lazy self to the dojo multiple times per week because I'm always training for the next level
- Invest hours of rehearsal into guitar, bass, or drums, because I get a huge thrill out of playing live music

If I have a "Why" then I can usually stay with it.  I'm hoping that the "Whys" I have for this blog 
will keep me on track, and help me to stay with it
